===============================
This is a classic Arcade Game. 

The game starts with one Player and three Enemies. In this game the Enemies are three bugs that run across the road. 

The goal of the game is for the Player to cross the road and reach the water. Once the Player reaches the water, the game is won and is reset. 

The Player needs to reach the water without colliding with any of the bugs. If the collision happens the game is reset and the Player is moved back to the start. 

The Player is manipulated via up, down, left, right keys on the keyboard.
