This is a classic Arcade Game. 

The game consists of a Player and an Enemy(ies). In this game the Enemy consists of three bugs. 

The goal of the game is for the Player to reach the water. Once the Player reaches water, the game is won and is reset. 

The Player needs to reach the water without colliding with any of the bugs. If the collision happens the game is reset and the Player is moved back to the start. 

The Player is manipulated via up, down, left, right keys on the keyboard.
